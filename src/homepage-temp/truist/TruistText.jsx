    p: "The Suntrust and BB&T merger has given birth to Truist One View, merging their digital commercial banking platform together. At just one-year-old, it's currently without a notification feature. While the product team diligently develops the essential functionalities, my role involves envisioning the ideal notification experience for clients. Under the guidance of Jennifer Fenrich, Design Director III, we aim to set a north-star vision for the future, considering the end-to-end journey. This case study explores the process of receiving and viewing notifications on the platform, not the alert management side."
