  Bck: "I graduated with a BFA in Web Design and Interactive Media from the Art Institute of Atlanta. I started my career as a web designer at a small design agency. But I seized the chance to work as an intern at Coca-Cola's User Experience and Content Department right away. During my time there, I worked on projects critical to the employees, like keeping the business mobility site up to date so that new or BYOT devices could be added, helping the team update the intranet site, and helping other departments use their data to make digital products."

   Bckext: "When working at Home Depot, I fell in love with the User-Centered Design method, which focuses on the needs and behaviors of the user to create products that are intuitive, usable, and delightful. We practice applying design thinking to our projects by solving problems with empathy, ideation, prototyping, and testing. This helps us come up with creative solutions that are focused on people. I was hooked! Since then, I've worked on projects that span the customer journey, such as the homepage, the product listing page, the product detail page, the account page, the shopping cart, and more—aiming to improve things big and small."
